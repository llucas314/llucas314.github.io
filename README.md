Have a look into some of my recent projects.

* [The Music Cove](https://llucas314.github.io/ui-pattern-project/) - A web site that searches Spotify's API for artists' info.

* [The Calluna](https://llucas314.github.io/Website-Mockup/) - My first attempt at recreating a mockup.

* [Simon Game](https://llucas314.github.io/simon-game/) - A take on the classic Hasbro game Simon.

* [National Parks Directory](https://zealous-villani-add409.netlify.com) - My first website built with ReactJS.
